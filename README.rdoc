Thought process:

I will make this app in rails. This both my comfort zone and the quickest way I can think of to get something functional. It will also make it much easier for me to make this app live so that it can be run from anywhere.

I am sure there are lighter weight way to do this but as functionity is the priory along with ontime complete this is my stratedy.

I will have a page that asks for a file upload that hits a controller that will parse the file by sending it to a model that will use a couple of algo's to calculate the output which will then send the info to a show page with an option to download to a csv file.
